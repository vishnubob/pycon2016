# Title
Fabrication with Python: How to use Python to make physical things.
Laser Cutters, 3D printers, and python

# Category
Other

# Duration
45 / 30 Mins

# Description
Python is an incredible language, but it does have one significant draw back: you can't touch what you make!  This talk is about leveraging python to generate physical, tangible things.  We will discuss the basics of laser cutters, 3D printers, and how you can use python to design physical objects.  After a brief introduction to these technologies, we will explore a few different examples of how we can use python to generate designs.

# Audience
Anyone who is curious about 3D printing, laser cutting, and combining this technology with python to design physical objects.

# Python Level
Novice

# Objectives
Attendees will learn the basic facts about laser cutters and 3D printers, and how they can use python to generate designs compatible with these systems.  

# Detailed Abstract
Python is a wonderfully expressive language.  It lowers the barrier between our imagination and implementation.  Most of the code a programmer writes, however, stays locked inside a computer, pulling data in, pushing data out, and rarely generates results that are literally tangible.  With the advent of cheap, sophisticated 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC machines, many enthusiasts are capable of using their home computer to make physical objects.  While most designs are built with graphical tools, Python is the great alternative to generating customizable, build-able designs.

After a brief introduction to laser cutters and 3D printers, how they work, and the types of file formats used to control them, I will focus on two simple example python projects, one for each technology.  For laser cutters, I will demonstrate how to use python to design a wood box with finger joins.  We will examine the geometry of a single face and discuss how to translate its geometry into code.  Once we establish the geometry of the box in python, we will add parameters to the design to make our box customizable.  

3D printing is more complicated, since it adds a dimension to our designs.  After an initial discussion about how 3D data is expressed, and how 3D printers use this data to generate objects, we will side-step the complexity of describing 3D data with triangles by leveraging OpenSCAD.  OpenSCAD is a programming environment in its own right, but its language is simple and lacks much of python's elegance and sophistication.  I will demonstrate how to drive OpenSCAD with python using [pyscad](https://github.com/vishnubob/pyscad).  Much like the laser cutter tutorial, we will model a simple object, a flower pot, using python.  We will break down its geometry and learn how to express it in terms of primitive solids.  From there, I will show how we can customize our flower pot script with different parameters.

I will also show two more python examples that are more sophisticated, to help catalyze your imagination.  The first is a [snowflake generator](https://github.com/vishnubob/snowflake) that generates diverse snowflakes for laser cutting.  The second is a [model-rocket generator](https://github.com/vishnubob/rockit) that builds customizable, ready-to-fly 3D model rockets for 3D printing.  

If you don't own your own 3D printer or laser cutter, no problem!  I will explain how to gain access to these tools through your public library, maker spaces, and services like Shapeways.  Feel free to browse the [supplemental page](https://github.com/vishnubob/pycon2016) for more information.

# Additional Notes
* Although this is my first PyCon talk proposal, I've presented a number of python projects and talks around the Boston area.
* Since it will be impossible to fabricate these objects during the talk, I will bring pre-fabricated versions of the examples for the attendees to examine in detail.
* I actively publish and support many python projects on my GitHub [profile](https://github.com/vishnubob).  My most popular project is my python [MIDI library](https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi), which I have maintained for over ten years.  All of the projects I will speak about are already published:
  * My laser cuttable snowflake generator is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/vishnubob/snowflake).
  * My 3D printable Model Rocket kit is published as an [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Rockit-Model-Rocket-Construction-Kit/), a model on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:262182), and a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/vishnubob/rockit).
  * My Python-SCAD Library is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/vishnubob/pyscad).
* This is a large amount of material to cover in 30 minutes.  My goal of this talk is to spark the imagination of folks who attend, instead of diving deep into the details.  I will supplement my talk with additional resources online and spend time at the conference to talk to folks who want more information.

# Additional Requirements
I will be showing short video clips with sound.  Although an audio hookup is not entirely necessary, it would be nice to have.
